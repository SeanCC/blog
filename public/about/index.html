Over the years, I’ve found that many projects that I work on on my own eventually get “lost to the void”. I wanted to have a place where I could put anything interseting that I do so I can refer back to it later and share it with other people.">

<p>Over the years, I’ve found that many projects that I work on on my own eventually get “lost to the void”. I wanted to have a place where I could put anything interseting that I do so I can refer back to it later and share it with other people. This is basically the home of all of my projects going forward. Anything I share here, I’ll try to point out difficulties I ran into and solutions I came up with, so that hopefully you won’t have to do the same amount of googling that I did!</p>
<p>If you want to reach out to me, you can send me an email at <a href="mailto:sean.ch.carter@gmail.com">sean.ch.carter@gmail.com</a></p>
<p>My resume can be downloaded <a href="https://seancc.github.io/docs/Charlie_Carter_Resume.docx">here</a></p>
<h1 id="about-this-blogportfolio">About this blog/portfolio</h1>
<p>This site is hosted on <a href="https://pages.github.com/">github pages</a>. It was built using a static page generator called <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>. The whole process was very easy and painless - if you have projects or work you’d like to showcase, I’d highly recommend going this route.</p>
