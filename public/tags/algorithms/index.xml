      <description>Note: This post is still undergoing &amp;lsquo;renovation&amp;rsquo; - images need to be cleaned up and mathematical notation inserted, but the core content is readable and correct.
Graphs are among the most basic and widely applicable mathematical structures. Modern applications in the study of social networks, spread of communicable diseases, computer networks, and many others, have made the study of graphs and their probabilistic counterpart, random graphs, especially relevant.
As a way of learning more about networks, I investigated algorithms for generating random graphs.</description>
