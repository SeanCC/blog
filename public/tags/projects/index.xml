      <description>Relative Harm and Pretrial Detention
According to the Prison Policy Institute in 2020, more than 470,000 people at any one time are sitting in local jails without a conviction. These people, along with many in federal detention, are in what is known as pretrial detention: they are sitting in jail awaiting the outcome of a court case. Many of these people will eventually accept plea deals - not necessarily because they are guilty, but because a guilty plea is the quickest way out.</description>

      <title>A Quick D&amp;D Experiment</title>

      <description>Just a quick experiment I was curious about! A few friends and I are starting up a new D&amp;amp;D campaign, and a player asked me how I prefer stats for characters to be determined. I&amp;rsquo;ve always preferred point buying, but I enjoy the randomness of rolling stats. I ran some simulations to get an idea of what kind of stat distributions different rolling methods give!
First, we define our functions for generating stats.</description>

      <title>An Analysis of the Competitive Lifetime of Powerlifters</title>

      <description>Brief overview
A survival analysis is conducted on the OpenPowerlifting.org dataset. Individual powerlifters and the length of time that they&amp;rsquo;ve been active (in terms of time from first to last meet and number of meets attended) are treated as survival objects. Survival curves are fitted and covariates are examined for effects.
This project was completed in part as a semester project for a Reliability Data Analysis course at the University of South Florida.</description>

      <title>Random Walkers and Web Crawlers</title>

      <description>Brief Overview: This was put together for a class assignment in Probability Theory 2. We were to discuss random walks and how they relate to the PageRank algorithm.
An overview of the relevant mathematics is given, and a small web crawler is implemented to collect links between wikipedia articles. The links are saved in a SQLite database and used later to construct a graph and rank articles based on centrality.</description>
