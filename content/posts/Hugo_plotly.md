In a [recent post on this blog](), I embedded dynamic visualizations for my first time. When I've generated dynamic visualizations before, I've generally done it with Tableau or Power BI, aside from occasional forays into Plotly Dash. Previous posts where I've embedded visualizations have had only static images. 

In this post, I just wanted to share how I produced the visualizations and got them to work in a post using Hugo.
