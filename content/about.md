title: "Whose Wobbles Are Wholesome And Good"
---

Hi! You've found the blog/portfolio of Sean Carter! I'm a graduate student in Statistics at the University of South Florida. 

Over the years, I've found that many projects that I work on eventually get "lost to the void". I wanted to have a place where I could put any interesting work that I do so I can refer back to it later and share it with other people. This is basically the home of all of my projects going forward. Anything I share here, I'll try to point out difficulties I ran into and solutions I came up with, so that hopefully you won't have to do the same amount of googling that I did! 

My blog title comes from a topic I studied as an undergraduate in Molecular Biology: [Wobble Base Pairing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wobble_base_pair). Something about the word "wobble" has always appealed to me.

If you want to reach out to me, you can send me an email at sean.ch.carter@gmail.com
